# 🔑 EKS Monitoring Stack Credentials

## ✅ Access Restored!

The admin account was locked due to too many incorrect login attempts. 
I've restarted the Grafana deployment and verified the credentials now work.

## 🔒 Important Security Notes

1. These credentials provide full admin access to your Grafana instance
2. Both services are exposed via AWS LoadBalancers with public internet access
3. Consider setting up TLS for production environments

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Log in to Grafana with the correct credentials
2. Verify your dashboards are loading data properly
3. Set up additional alerts if needed

## 📝 Tips

If you get locked out again, you can restart the Grafana pod:
```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment/grafana -n monitoring
```

To verify the admin password at any time, check the deployment configuration:
```bash
kubectl get deployment grafana -n monitoring -o yaml | grep GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD
```
